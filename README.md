# Sentiment Analysis Over Time

## reddit-sentiment
This project analyses the sentiment towards various entities like companies or concepts over time. The sentiment is gauged based on comments from the Reddit API.

## Project Goals
The aim of this project is to analyze how sentiment changes over time for various entities such as individuals, companies, technologies, and locations.

## Target Audience
The primary audience for this project includes organizations seeking insights about sentiment towards their products, staff, and potential technologies for future products. The information generated by this project can be used to support design and business decisions.

## Features
The project features include:
- Extraction of keywords for certain organizations/concepts (visualized in a word cloud)
- Sentiment rating for different companies
- Rate of change of sentiment for each company
- Sentiment towards specific concepts
- Volume of comments bar chart in the last 24 hours

## The data to be extracted for analysis includes:
- Post title
- Time post was made
- Comments

## File Structure
The main components of this project are two python files, `app.py` and `load.py`, and a SQL script `create_tables.sql`.

`app.py` is responsible for extracting data from the Reddit API and storing it in an S3 bucket. It utilises PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) and NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) for sentiment analysis.

`load.py` is a script that loads the data into PostgreSQL tables. It downloads the data from the S3 bucket, connects to the PostgreSQL database, creates the necessary tables using the `create_tables.sql` file, and then populates these tables with the data.

The `create_tables.sql` file is located in the Load directory. It contains SQL commands to create tables for storing the extracted data.

## Getting Started
To start with the project, follow these steps:

1. Set up your Reddit API by going to: `https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps` 
2. Set your URI to: `http://localhost:8080`
3. Get your `ID` and `secret key`.
4. Clone the project repository.
5. Set up your environment variables in a .env file, including your Reddit API credentials and AWS S3 bucket details.
6. Run `app.py` to extract data from the Reddit API and upload it to the S3 bucket.
7. Execute `load.py` to download the data from the S3 bucket, create the necessary tables in the PostgreSQL database, and load the data into these tables.

Note: Ensure that the `create_tables.sql` file is in the same directory as the `load.py` file or adjust the path in the `load.py` file accordingly.
