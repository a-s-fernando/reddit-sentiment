Generally phones work ok on cellular and low level streaming like utube but netflix/Apple etc won\u2019t stream well if at all.

It\u2019s been going on for years. An hour or two any direction and you\u2019ve got a choice of companies like comcast, centurylink, etc with much better service. \n\nIs there a way to set up our own service? Is this even practical?

(Unless it's bought by a delusional billionaire with a porcelain ego so that he can be the main character, but I digress.)  To wit, they need *engagement*.  That is ALL that they care about.  It doesn't matter if they're showing you the next video from your favorite vlogger, clickbait, or extremist bullcrap to rile people up; if serving it up keeps people reading or watching, they'll serve it.\n\n(Other media is guilty of this too.  Donald Trump's political career would never have been anything other than a footnote in 2016 except his antics were attention-getting, and news organizations gave him more free coverage than any candidate could ever have dreamed of because it got them audiences.)\n\n2)  It absolutely *is* the responsibility of people to think critically about what they're told to believe.  We are surrounded by manipulation, practically drowning in it, every day of our lives.  Politicians say total bullshit to get you to vote for them, billionaires fund those politicians as well as think tanks and news outlets to push their own agendas, and every damn company out there wants you to believe that their products are the solutions to all of your problems.  Anyone who *doesn't* discern what's real or fake ends up a mindless puppet so clueless that they think it's their own hand up their ass.\n\nWe all need to be able to determine when and how we're being manipulated, otherwise the same politicians who make our problems keep getting voted in by blaming others, we actually believe @PatriotMomUSA88's blurry-ass memes about vaccines causing autism, and we go broke buying Jookie soda to try to be cool.\n\nThat said, I think that social media, and other companies, absolutely *should* be held culpable for harmful manipulation.  At best they don't care about the side effects, and at worst they actively pursue them, and the harms to people and society are real.\n\nBut at the end of the day, YouTube didn't put a gun in a psycho's hand and tell him to kill people.

I visit social media a couple of times a week to read the news and watch clips from TV shows (Facebook).

It's 4chan, a bunch of angry asshole teenage boys screaming into the void is the 90's internet in a nutshell.\n\n> For example: the mass shootings in USA are a \"people problem\" but it is a \"people problem\" that would severely diminish if the technology (in this case, guns) could be regulated with some common sense laws, as shown by *every single developed country* that has reduced gun deaths by implementing common sense gun regulation.\n\nExcept you're wrong. \n\nThe gun violence issue in the US is **not** a people problem,quite simply because it doesn't exist everywhere there are people. In fact it basically doesn't exist **anywhere** other than the US regardless of the level of gun ownership or anything else for that matter.\n\nIt's the result not just of how many guns are available, but of how those guns are viewed, how they are used and permitted to be used, the social safety net or lack thereof, the level of individualism, and a whole host of other characteristics that in the end create the societal fingerprint of the US.\n\nIt's a gigantic system problem that needs a whole host of fixes (some of which could be implemented without significantly affecting gun rights).\n\nConversely, what we're seeing with social media **does** exist everywhere regardless of religion, wealth, politics, culture, language or any other factor. It has always existed and probably will always exist. You can bring the hammer down of Facebook, but it won't do anything, because Facebook is the symptom not the disease. \n\n> Please excuse me for being rude, but you saying it's a \"people problem\" smacks of the same people who claim guns aren't a problem.\n\nBecause you've misunderstood basically everything I've said.\n\nGun violence isn't a people problem, it's not as simple as you seem to think it is, but it's not a people problem. It's not even a generic violence problem. Walking into a shopping mall and blowing children away is an **AMERICAN** problem.",

He moved to \\[city\\] for college, and stayed for the job. After a few years, he decided he wanted to move back home to be near his family.\n\nThe boss asked if there was anything he could do to keep him onboard. They eventually came up with the WFH idea (this was long before COVID). Boss had to do a lot of work to get his bosses to approve it, but he did. \n\nAs a bonus, because this guy is several time zones away, he works slightly different hours, and will very frequently solve our problems while we sleep. It's like having a magical office ferry -- the day's almost over and I can't solve this problem? I send him an e-mail asking for help at the end of the day, and when I arrive the next morning, the solution is there waiting for me.",

And TBH I'm surprised it's not more now, with everyone wanting data for AI. And it takes a bot a second to request a thousand web pages, compare that to a user and yeah, that's why they use more traffic.\n\nEdit: Okay I'm gonna take back this comment because the Bad Bot Report apparently specifies bots with malintent, so not webscrapers.\n\nSo yeah, it's actually pretty bad. I guess when you're thinking about fake reviews, fake social media engagement, fake likes/upvoted, fake ratings on the play store, yeah it adds up, and it seems like Amazon, app stores, etc. is mostly fake reviews and ratings.

That night total internet traffic went down by some astronomical % (edit: I was off on timing)\n\nEDIT: DND Episode 110\n\n>Nikolai and McColo Corp were known for turning a blind eye to what their clients were doing with their servers.  So, the McColo hosting provider was a safe haven for spammers, and criminals were happy to use the service.  There was a lot of criminal activity on McColo\u2019s servers; from hosting big spam botnets to clients involved in spamming for fake goods, fake drugs, and a lot of shady pornography.  McColo Corp had a good reputation for hosting bad things.  So, on September 2, 2007, Nikolai McColo was riding in a BMW through Moscow.  The driver was a guy named Jaks, a known Russian spammer.  When they got to an intersection in the middle of Moscow city, a Porsche drove up beside them.  Jaks and Nikolai looked over at the Porsche.  Both cars came to a red light and stopped side by side.  One of them revved the engine; the other revved back.  A race was about to begin.  When the lights turned green, both cars roared off at high speed, but it all went wrong.  Jaks lost control of his car.  The BMW went into a spin and clipped the corner of the Porsche.\n\n>Both cars went screaming off the road, and the BMW went straight into a lamppost.  It totally destroyed the car, and Nikolai was killed instantly at the age of twenty-three.  Jaks and the guy driving the Porsche walked away with minor injuries.  This was big news across the spammer community.  At Nikolai\u2019s funeral, Igor and Dmitry-Stupin from Glavmed were there, and Google was, too.  They knew the importance of Nikolai\u2019s McColo Corp for the spamming world and its hosting services, and they were fairly close to him.  So, they were wondering how Nikolai\u2019s death was going to impact McColo and the hosting.\n\n[Then later](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/how-a-car-wreck-in-a-moscow-square-affected-the-spam-we-receive-everyday-20141229-12f177.html):\n\n>That is, until the evening of November 11, 2008, when an expose in The Washington Post about the high concentration of malicious activity at the hosting provider prompted the two suppliers of McColo's connection to the larger internet to simultaneously pull the plug on the firm. In an instant, spam volumes plummeted by as much as 75 per cent worldwide, as millions of spam bots were disconnected from their control servers and scattered to the four winds like sheep without a shepherd.",

The move by YouTube also signaled a change in the way the platform would tackle fake views and bot traffic.[4]\n\nIn 2023, the audio streaming platform Spotify.com removed tens of thousands of songs, corresponding to 7% of its catalogue, because they were AI-generated music from the online service Boomy, uploaded to be \"listened\" by bots and boost the streaming numbers of such songs, trying to generate revenues proportional to non-human access to the songs.[5]\u201d\n\nYou can watch a vid on this here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/INMpsFfhaVk\n\n\nI love living in an era where multiple dystopian apocalypses are possible lol.",

Billboards work well for local businesses as they advertise to people within range of the business, but companies that operate nationwide/worldwide that doesn't help much. They'd have to put up a lot of billboards. Same for advertising on busses, it's an option, just not a great one. \n\nThe internet is the medium where your ads reach the most people over a wider geographical area. Even if half of your ad views are bots, if you get ten million impressions, that's 5,000,000 people seeing your ads. Almost nothing but sports gets that many viewers on cable now, and I doubt there's any FM or AM radio program that gets that many impressions.  \n\nSo internet advertising is the best option, even if it is a very imperfect option.",

When you upvote or downvote a post on reddit, it barely matters, because someone somewhere paid to have 100k upvotes added to a post - of course, this is done by bots, not humans. And Elon is right too. Of course, he didn't mention that most of his own followers and reposters were bots too.\n\nIt's not the bots that gather data that are a problem for the most part - Search engines have been doing it since the 1990s and nobody cared. It's the bots that generate content and choose what you end up seeing that are a problem. And I specifically mean artificial upvotes and downvotes, not the fact that algorithms influence what gets seen (that is to be expected).",

Turns out you\u2019re supposed to do this in your profile settings, not from the report button.\n\n* After the a Uvalade shooting, the police subreddit bragged about banning a bunch of people who had criticized the police response.

Probably because he was nowhere near as crazy as Trump.\n\nBy the time 2016 rolled around, reddit had increased in size massively, and even dinosaurs had a better understanding of how important the Internet was as a platform for politics. So it was allllll propaganda, all polarized. And the candidates this time were \"unlikeable woman, professional politician with shady history\" or \"potentially demented crazy dude who's almost certainly a pedo\". It was way closer than Obama vs Romney and the bot spam was way more important.\n\nNowadays, reddit is unrecognizable. Everyone is constantly trying to sell you something, whether it's a political opinion, a product, or onlyfans. Bots are everywhere, as are people whose literal job it is to market shit on reddit.\n\nI'm calling it now. Reddit will see growth for max 5 more years till it starts to decline.

This is where everyone and their uncle are nuclear bros because they listened to a cool YouTube video. \n\nLet me be clear: that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s without merit, nuclear is fucking cool and Gen IV reactors are gonna kick ass. I *want* to be a huge nuclear power stan and I want to be there with them. Hell, I know *more* than them about the technology and engineering. \n\nThe issue is that the feverous support train doesn\u2019t realize that there\u2019s actual problems *beyond* the science with nuclear.  The science and safety is 100% there but the scalability of the technology is completely hampered on the civil side. \n\nThe reason why nuclear power plants aren\u2019t popping up everywhere in the US by venture capital is because the infrastructure is absolutely not there to support it right now. \n\nWe have this cognitive dissonance going on where this amazing technology is being hampered by really boring issues. \n\nIssues like interstate waste transport. \n\nIssues like water and property rights.  \n\nIssues like sourcing and transporting the RAM between states. \n\nIssues like power delivery and distribution at scale beyond metropolitan areas. \n\nIssues like states actively pushing back against nuclear like Yucca Mountain in Neveda. (Which is a sad story yall should read. We coulda been Star Trek. Fuck you Nevada. Coulda had enough room to safely store thousands of years of RAM safely for the whole world without issue.)\n\nAnyway. That\u2019s my rant. \n\nTL;DR they\u2019re not wrong they\u2019re just not understanding why their cognitive dissonance isn\u2019t manifesting.

Most of the conversations have already been had and beaten to death so most of the arguments are simply copy pasta.

Lets face it, if you're a regular of any of those subreddits then you know what 90% of the comments are going to be before you even see them based on whatever the thread is about.\n\nReddit isn't really big on diversity of thought.

If we as a species were up to the challenge of today's pace of change, Reddit, Microsoft, IBM, and any other big company you can think of would stay on top. Instead, you put something out there, it goes great, and before you can refactor, the whole world moves on to somebody else's thing.\n\nWhat happens to have changed in the last 10 years for me on Reddit is, I now filter not just the bad subs / domains / users, but also a TON of stuff I'm interested in. It used to be that you could find good threads if you looked hard enough. Now, that still applies, but it's stopped applying to some subs just because the narrative gets legs and runs a weird direction. This is a double edged sword: Some subs like here turn into a soap opera, and some look the same but really it's just not my flavor of echo chamber, and telling the difference is today's challenge.\n\nI look forward to what stretches wonkward next.",

You have to get out of the plains and the easy to reach areas, venture into the states with lower populations.

Humans are resilient and obsessed with their own creations, but we tend to crush the life out of anything that is different and beautiful in it's own way.\n\nI miss the old internet. Full of unpolished forums, anonymous users giving out good advice or references. If you wanted to find something out you could find dozens of dedicated forums with people who had asked similar questions, for the most part it was good advice without dumb jokes or pop culture references you had to wade through. Now social media of every kind is full of the same brainless reposts stolen from ticktock, reddit, or 4chan. There's dedicated YouTube channels that are the replies to reddit posts.

The actual job of an EE isn't cool and requires adherence to an extremely conformist manufacturing tech job that most teenagers getting into the business (or at least college) can't conceive of when they start going to college for it. Actually sitting on a production line and poking things, or using a machine to poke things, and learning how ladder logic works is incredibly frustrating. The EE jobs we need are not manager jobs but something closer to workshop technicians working with soldering irons, or comparable equipment depending on the size of the device. Most teenagers entering college for this have never picked up a hammer because trade work was largely eliminated from the K12 system, especially at high-value schools in high-value markets where fabs are being set up.\n\nTo which point, it's a Fab. A Fabrication Plant. A Manu-factory. A Factory. Everyone wants to make the next laser gun but nobody wants to build 300 of someone else's laser gun (or rather, a laser gun assembly that itself is useless outside of a bigger device it slots into). The real job here is fostering an environment that avoids the problems Foxconn has, because it's that environment that literally breaks people and prevents a given product from being reliably produced. That's why there are so many openings. These *exact* same problems hit mechanical workers a century ago, and those lessons shouldn't be ignored.",

On the \"For you\" Tab is quiet entertaining (tiktok style) but it shows me mostly Elon, Elon, memes, Influencers, Elon and some random dudes talking about some of my interests. I guess Twitter is not for me anymore.",
